                        <strong>Elon Reeve Musk (born June 28, 1971) is a South 
                        African-born Canadian-American business magnate, engineer, 
                        and investor
                        </strong>
                    </p></br>
                    <p>
                        He is the founder, CEO and CTO of SpaceX; co-founder, 
                        CEO and product architect of Tesla Motors; chairman of 
                        SolarCity, co-chairman of OpenAI; co-founder of Zip2; 
                        and co-founder of PayPal. As of April 2016, he has an 
                        estimated net worth of US$14.2 billion, making him the 
                        68th wealthiest person in the US.<br/> 
                        Musk has stated that the goals of SolarCity, Tesla 
                        Motors, and SpaceX revolve around his vision to change 
                        the world and humanity. His goals include reducing global
                        warming through sustainable energy production and consumption, 
                        and reducing the "risk of human extinction" by "making life 
                        multiplanetary" by setting up a human colony on Mars.<br/>
                        He has envisioned a high-speed transportation system 
                        known as the Hyperloop, and has proposed a VTOL supersonic 
                        jet aircraft with electric fan propulsion, known as the Musk
                        electric jet.</p></br>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1995</strong>, Musk and his brother, Kimbal, started 
                            Zip2, a web software company, with US$28,000 of their father's 
                            (Errol Musk) money. The company developed and marketed an 
                            Internet "city guide" for the newspaper publishing industry. 
                            Musk obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago 
                            Tribune and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans 
                            for a merger with CitySearch. While at Zip2, Musk wanted to 
                            become CEO; however, none of the board members would allow it. 
                            Compaq acquired Zip2 for US$307 million in cash and US$34 million 
                            in stock options in February 1999. Musk received 7% or US$22 million 
                            from the sale.
                        </li><br/>
                        <li><strong>1999</strong>, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial 
                            services and e-mail payment company, with US$10 million from the 
                            sale of Zip2. One year later, the company merged with Confinity, 
                            which had a money transfer service called PayPal. The merged company 
                            focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001. 
                            PayPal's early growth was driven mainly by a viral marketing 
                            campaign where new customers were recruited when they received money 
                            through the service. Musk was later ousted from his role as CEO due 
                            to disagreements with other company leadership, notably over his desire 
                            to move PayPal's Unix-based infrastructure to Microsoft Windows. 
                            In October 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for US$1.5 billion in 
                            stock, of which Musk received US$165 million. Before its sale, 
                            Musk, who was the company's largest shareholder, owned 11.7% of 
                            PayPal's shares.
                        </li><br/>
                        <li><strong>2006</strong>, SpaceX was awarded a contract from NASA to 
                            continue the development and test of the SpaceX Falcon 9 launch 
                            vehicle and Dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the 
                            International Space Station, followed by a US$1.6 billion NASA launch 
                            contract on December 23, 2008, for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket 
                            and Dragon spacecraft to the Space Station, replacing the US Space 
                            Shuttle after it retired in 2011. SpaceX is one of two contractors 
                            in the Commercial Resupply Services program which replaced the 
                            cargo transport function of the Space Shuttle. Astronaut transport 
                            to the ISS is currently handled solely by the Soyuz, but as of 2014, 
                            SpaceX is also one of two companies remaining in the Commercial Crew 
                            Development program, which is intended to develop a US astronaut 
                            transport capability.
                        </li><br/>
                        <li><strong>2006</strong>, Tesla Motors was incorporated by Martin Eberhard 
                            and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round 
                            of funding. Both men played active roles in the company's early 
                            development prior to Elon Musk's involvement. Musk led the Series 
                            A round of investment in February 2004, joining Tesla's board of 
                            directors as its chairman. Musk took an active role within the 
                            company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, 
                            but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations. 
                            Following the financial crisis in 2008, Musk assumed leadership 
                            of the company as CEO and product architect, positions he still 
                            holds today. Tesla Motors first built an electric sports car, 
                            the Tesla Roadster, with sales of about 2,500 vehicles to 31 
                            countries. Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan 
                            on June 22, 2012. It unveiled its third product, the Model X, 
                            aimed at the SUV/minivan market, on February 9, 2012; the Model X 
                            launch was however delayed until September 2015. In addition to 
                            its own cars, Tesla sells electric powertrain systems to Daimler 
                            for the Smart EV, Mercedes B-Class Electric Drive and Mercedes A 
                            Class and to Toyota for the RAV4 EV. Musk was able to bring in both 
                            companies as long-term investors in Tesla.
                        </li><br/>
                        <li><strong>2006</strong>, Musk provided the initial concept and financial 
                            capital for SolarCity, which was then co-founded by his cousins Lyndon 
                            and Peter Rive. Musk remains the largest shareholder. SolarCity is now 
                            the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States. 
                            The underlying motivation for funding both SolarCity and Tesla is to 
                            help combat global warming. In 2012, Musk announced that SolarCity and 
                            Tesla Motors are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to 
                            smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid, with the program 
                            going live in 2013. On June 17, 2014, Musk committed to building in 
                            Buffalo, New York, a SolarCity advanced production facility that would 
                            triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States. Musk 
                            stated the plant will be "one of the single largest solar panel 
                            production plants in the world", and it will be followed by one or more 
                            even bigger facilities in subsequent years.
                        </li><br/>
                        <li><strong>2013</strong>, Musk unveiled a concept for a high-speed 
                            transportation system incorporating reduced-pressure tubes in 
                            which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear 
                            induction motors and air compressors. The mechanism for releasing 
                            the concept was an alpha-design document that, in addition to 
                            scoping out the technology, outlined a notional route where such 
                            a transport system might be built: between the Greater Los Angeles 
                            Area and the San Francisco Bay Area. After earlier envisioning 
                            Hyperloop, Musk assigned a dozen engineers from Tesla Motors and 
                            SpaceX who worked for nine months, establishing the conceptual 
                            foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system. 
                            An early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper 
                            posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs. Musk's proposal, if technologically 
                            feasible at the costs he has cited, would make travel cheaper than any 
                            other mode of transport for such long distances. The alpha design was 
                            proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag, which it 
                            is theorized would allow for high-speed travel with relatively low power, 
                            with certain other features like air-bearing skis and an inlet compressor 
                            to reduce air drag. The alpha design document estimated the total cost of 
                            an LA-to-SF Hyperloop system at US$6 billion, but this amount is speculative. 
                            In June 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to 
                            build Hyperloop pods to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track in a 
                            2016 Hyperloop pod competition. That track is currently under construction 
                            and the competition is slated for August 2016.

                        <li><strong>2015</strong>, Elon Musk announced the creation of OpenAI, 
                            a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company. 
                            OpenAI aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way 
                            that is safe and beneficial to humanity. By making AI available 
                            to everyone, OpenAI wants to "counteract large corporations who 
                            may gain too much power by owning super-intelligence systems devoted 
                            to profits, as well as governments which may use AI to gain power 
                            and even oppress their citizenry".
